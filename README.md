# User Management Dashboard

This is a simple React project I built as part of my assignment.  
The app lets you manage a list of users with basic features like adding new users, editing existing ones, deleting them, and searching through the list.  

I used **React**, **Axios**, and **Vite** to build it. For the backend, I connected it to a free API (JSONPlaceholder), which provides fake user data for testing. The changes you make (like add/edit/delete) are shown in the UI but won’t be saved permanently since the API is just for demo purposes.

## 🚀 What I Did
- Created a **user form** to add or edit details like name, email, and username.  
- Built a **table view** that lists all users with options to edit or delete each one.  
- Added a **search bar** to quickly filter through users.  
- Implemented a **confirmation dialog** before deleting users to avoid mistakes.  
- Deployed the project on **Netlify**.
